        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>At RaV, we believe that the future of transportation is electric. Our journey began when a group
            of avid cyclists, nature enthusiasts, and sustainability advocates came together to create an accessible and
            enjoyable way for people to experience the world on two wheels. Our e-bike rental company was born out of
            the desire to share the thrill of electric biking and to make outdoor adventures more accessible to
            everyone.</p>
